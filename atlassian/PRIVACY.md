## Privacy Policy - Sprint Timesheet

Effective date: 2026-01-23

This Privacy Policy describes how the Sprint Timesheet desktop app ("App") and
its Atlassian API token authentication handle information.

### Summary

- The App runs locally on your device.
- We do not run a backend service for this App.
- Your data is fetched directly from Atlassian and stored locally on your device.

### Information We Access

When you connect your Atlassian account, the App may access:

- Your Atlassian API token.
- Your Atlassian account ID and display name.
- Jira data needed to show your sprint worklogs, such as boards, sprints,
  issues, statuses, labels, story points, and worklogs.
- App settings you provide (for example, board ID).

### How We Use Information

We use this information only to:

- Authenticate you with Atlassian.
- Fetch and display sprint and worklog data.
- Let you update worklog hours and issue status.

### Storage and Retention

All data is stored locally on your device using the App's local storage. We do
not store your data on our servers. You can remove local data by signing out in
the App or uninstalling the App.

### Sharing

We do not sell or share your data with third parties. Data is exchanged only
between your device and Atlassian's APIs.

### Analytics and Tracking

We do not use analytics, trackers, or advertising in the App.

### Security

We rely on your device's operating system and local storage protections. No
system is perfectly secure, so please use appropriate device security.

### Your Choices

- You can revoke access by signing out or by revoking the API token in your
  Atlassian account settings.
- You can delete local data by clearing the App's data or uninstalling it.

### Changes

We may update this policy from time to time. Updates will be published in this
repository.
